# VSCodeFirstUpper  
#### A port of my Notepad++ Extension "FirstUpper" to Visual Studio Code.

## Features
### Properly capitalize the words in a selection.
> This option capitalizes the words in a selection according to the Chicago Manual of Style. This is appropriate for titles.

### Properly capitalize all of the titles in a Markdown document.
> This option scans the entire markdown document for titles with the preceding character(s) of `#` and capitalizes them according to the Chicago Manual of Style. This feature also respects "setext" style titles such as:
> 
>        This is a Title
>        ---
>
> or
>
>        This is also a Title
